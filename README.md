#### Predciting short term energy/power consumption usage in buildings through machine learning techiniques.


Short-term building cooling load prediction is the essential foundation for many building energy management tasks, such as fault detection and diagnosis, demand-side management, control optimization and interactions between buildings and smart grid. Conventional methods, which heavily rely on physical principles, have limited power in practice as their performance is subject to many physical assumptions.

The rapid development in data science has provided advanced data analytics to tackle prediction problems in a more convenient, efficient and effective way.

So with the help of Applied Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques we will try to predict short term ( 1 day - 7 days ahead ) energy usage in buildings and its demand-response.

**Dataset required:** All the state of the art research which has been done till now on this area, usually consist of a yearly or 2 year dataset taken at an interval of anything between 5 minutes to an hour.

**Features Vectors:** Input vectors: Dry Bulb Temperature, Relative Humidity, Global Solar Radiation. output vectors: Energy consumed.
